> Python can be used to Sript/OO/Functional/Imperative
> Advantages of Python
    1) Portable
    2) Less coding
      Five times less to accomplish same task as Java/C++
    3) Interpreted language
    4) Extensive Libraries
> Slow in compiling
  switch to faster Python implementations, such as PyPy, which provides an average 7-fold speedup by implementing advanced compilation techniques
  Python, such as Pandas and Numpy, achieve native speed due to the way they are implemented
